I'm Andrey Shalaev, a software developer from Kiev, Ukraine. I'm also a dancer, chemist, play the guitar and code a lot.


I love writing clean code in Python and JavaScript. Currently I'm learning more about these languages as well as C and Kotlin.
I'm friendly and hard-working, and fond of working on and completing hard but interesing projects.
